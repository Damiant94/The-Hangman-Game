# The Hangman Game
My implementation of The Hangman Game.\
User need to guess letters to reveal the word.\
User has 9 lives, so after pick wrong letter 9 times, he loses.\
When user pick all letters, which the word contains, he wins.\
After win or fail, user can check the definition(s) of the word.\
User can click on any word of definition, to get definition of this word in outer source.
